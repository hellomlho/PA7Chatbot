        Welcome to the MovieBot! I help you find great movies based on what you like.
        Tell me about a movie you've watched by mentioning its title in quotation marks
        (e.g., "Inception") and sharing your thoughts. I'll use that information to
        recommend movies you might enjoy. Let's get started!
        
[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0mHi! I'm a Movie Bot. How can I help you?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0mNot sure about your opinion on "Titanic (1997)". Care to share more details?
> I like "Titanic".

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0mLooks like there are multiple versions of that film! Any specifics?
> I thought "Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220)" was a really great movie.

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0mHmm, "Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220)" doesnâ€™t ring a bell. Maybe a different movie?
> I loved zootopia

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0mI can't quite tell if that's a movie title. Try adding quotes around it!
> I liked both "Zootopia" and "Titanic (1997)".

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0mNice! You liked "Titanic (1997)"! Any other movies you'd recommend?
> :quit
