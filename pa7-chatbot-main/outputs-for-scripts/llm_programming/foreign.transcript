        Welcome to the MovieBot! I help you find great movies based on what you like.
        Tell me about a movie you've watched by mentioning its title in quotation marks
        (e.g., "Inception") and sharing your thoughts. I'll use that information to
        recommend movies you might enjoy. Let's get started!
