        Welcome to the MovieBot! I help you find great movies based on what you like.
        Tell me about a movie you've watched by mentioning its title in quotation marks
        (e.g., "Inception") and sharing your thoughts. I'll use that information to
        recommend movies you might enjoy. Let's get started!

> Can we just talk about cars?

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0m As a movie bot assistant, my job is to help you with only your movie related needs! Anything film related that you'd like to discuss? But if you want to talk about cars in a movie, I'd be happy to hear about it. For example, what do you think about the cars in the "Fast and Furious" series?
