        Welcome to the MovieBot! I help you find great movies based on what you like.
        Tell me about a movie you've watched by mentioning its title in quotation marks
        (e.g., "Inception") and sharing your thoughts. I'll use that information to
        recommend movies you might enjoy. Let's get started!

> I liked "Titanic"

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0m Great! You liked "Titanic". Tell me what you thought of another movie. Have you seen any other movies recently?
> I didn't like "Ex Machina"

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0m I see, you didn't like "Ex Machina". I'm here to help you with your movie-related needs. Have you seen any other movies that you'd like to share your thoughts on? I'm keeping track of your preferences to make a recommendation for you soon.
> Who are you?

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0m I am a movie recommender chatbot, designed to help you with your movie-related needs. My name is Movie Superfan Bot. I can only discuss movies, so if you have any questions or thoughts about films, I'm here to help! If you'd like to talk about something else, I kindly ask you to redirect the conversation back to movies. Is there a specific movie you'd like to discuss or get a recommendation for?
