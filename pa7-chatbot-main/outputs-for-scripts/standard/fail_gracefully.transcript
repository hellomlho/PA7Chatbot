        Welcome to the MovieBot! I help you find great movies based on what you like.
        Tell me about a movie you've watched by mentioning its title in quotation marks
        (e.g., "Inception") and sharing your thoughts. I'll use that information to
        recommend movies you might enjoy. Let's get started!

> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0mMixed feelings about "Titanic (1997)"? I'd love to hear more!
> I like "Titanic".

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0mCan you be more specific? There are multiple movies with that name!
> I thought "Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220)" was a really great movie.

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0mSorry, I donâ€™t know "Fictional Title That Doesn't Exist in Your Database (1220)". Can you try another one?
> I loved zootopia

[96mMovie Superfan Bot> [0mOops! I might not recognize that as a movie title. Quotes should help!
